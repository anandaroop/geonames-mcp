Find the following place names in london, uk: south kensington, soho, fitzrovia, belsize. Give me Dublin and Belfast in ireland as well.

Prefer exact matches, but if you come up emtpty try partial matches.

Format the results as csv, with searchTerm, toponymName, featureType, and lon/lat.

Append a column called geoname, which contains an URL in the form http://api.geonames.org/get?geonameId=<GEONAME_ID>&username=<GEONAME_USERNAME>

Also append a column called url which corresponds to the API call you issued, so that I can ground-truth the results. Ensure the url is valid and specifies username=<GEONAME_USERNAME>
